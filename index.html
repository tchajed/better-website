    <h1>This is a website</h1>
    <p>It took 12 lines of CSS to make it look decent, even on mobile:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
&lt;style&gt;
body {
  margin: 2em auto;
  max-width: 800px;
  font-size: 18px;
  padding: 1em;
  text-align: justify;
}
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  line-height: 1.2;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>
      </pre>

    <p>
      This website additionally has
      <code>font-family: Arial, sans-serif;</code>. I personally like using Open
      Sans but then you need to go to Google Fonts and copy the embed code for
      it and you're a busy person, you don't have time for that.
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Especially in academia, I still see course websites from 2025 that look
      identical to the ones from 2006.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
      I learned from the
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">better</a> and the
      <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">best</a>. However, those
      websites (a) involve swearing, and (b) require inspecting the web source
      to copy from. Academics don't have time to open dev tools.
    </p>
    <h2>Can I do this too?</h2>
    <p>
      Sure. The code above is licensed under the MIT license or the Apache
      license, at your option. Just copy-paste it to your website's
      <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.
    </p>
    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>
      Here's <a href="https://chajed.io">my website</a>. It has more than 12
      lines of CSS.
